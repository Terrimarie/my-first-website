# My Very First Web Page

## Project description
This is my first web page created using HTML and CSS. This web page project has been created so the user can use the website to learn more about coding languages and CLI's. They can navigate from page to page using the navigation bar at the top of each page. There are image icons for each coding language and a titled hyperlink for each directing you to the wikipedia page for each coding language or CLI.
